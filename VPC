🚀 What is a VPC?
A Virtual Private Cloud is your own private network inside the cloud.
Think of it like creating your own mini–data center in AWS, Azure, or GCP — but virtual.

🧱 Key Components of a VPC
1. Subnets

Smaller network segments inside the VPC
Two types:

Public Subnet → Internet-facing (e.g., load balancers, bastion hosts)
Private Subnet → Internal only (e.g., databases, app servers)

2. Route Tables
Define how traffic flows in the VPC.
3. Internet Gateway (IGW)
Allows resources in public subnets to access the internet.
4. NAT Gateway
Allows private subnet instances to access the internet (for updates) without being exposed.
5. Security Groups
Firewall rules at the instance level.
6. Network ACLs
Firewall rules at the subnet level.
7. CIDR Block
The IP address range of your VPC (example: 10.0.0.0/16).
